# Command-Line-Blackjack-Game
A command-line blackjack game that allows you to play against a dealer with perfect strategy, can you beat the house?


Run the main java file and follow the terminal prompts. 
The game is straight forward and intuative and follows classic Blackjack casino rules.
The player is able to bet money on each hand and, depending on who wins the hand, gain or lose funds from their bankroll.
The game ends when either the player runs out of funds or the bank loses all their money. 

The project was written in IntelliJ IDEA so this repo contains all the necessary files to run this in that specific IDE. 
If you do not have IntelliJ then you can ignore these files and simply use the contense of the 'src' and 'out' directories. 

The game is written using Object oriented design principles and Java.

Currently, the game does not have the ability to split your cards but this will be added shortly.
